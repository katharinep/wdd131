			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of this site is to be a genealogy blog as a form of self promotion for research services. It will include articles and a page with mock links to documents to help with research, including "cheat sheets" and research forms (research logs, evidence analysis chart, etc.)</p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>My main audience is potential clients. My secondary audience is other professionals for the purpose of building credibility and opening career opportunities. </p>

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>There will be a form for service inquiries (conditional branching). There will be a drop down menu to select reason for inquiry. (record lookup, research project, speaking opportunities) There will also be event listeners on the child site that watches for clicking on document links. The article data will be saved in a separate .js file. A simple search bar ought to fulfill the object and array requirements.</p>

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>Some useful images for this site are in the images folder. Here is content for two blog posts. 
                Title: Understanding Census Records
                Tags: census, records, U.S. research
                Content: Census records are a valuable resource for genealogists, offering snapshots of family life across decades. These records often include names, ages, occupations, and birthplaces, making them an essential starting point for tracing ancestral lines. Though the information may vary from one census year to another, the cumulative data helps researchers build timelines and identify family relationships. Always consider spelling variations and transcription errors when searching for ancestors in census databases.
                
                Title: German Church Records and What They Reveal
                Tags: German records, church books, baptism, marriage, death, European genealogy
                Content: German church records are a goldmine of genealogical information, often predating civil registrations. Baptismal, marriage, and burial entries provide names, dates, and crucial family connections that help reconstruct family trees with confidence. These records are usually written in Gothic script or Latin, which can pose challenges to modern researchers, but their detail and consistency make them worth the effort. Understanding local customs and religious divisions can also help narrow the search in specific regions.
